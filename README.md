```lrc
[00:07.82] It's Christmas time
[00:11.45] There's no need to be afraid
[00:16.53] At Christmas time
[00:19.02] We let in light and we banish shade
[00:36.52] 
[00:24.44] And in our world of plenty
[00:29.40] We can spread a smile of joy
[00:33.30] Throw your arms around the world
[00:36.81] At Christmas time
[00:45.31] 
[00:41.62] But say a prayer
[00:43.83] Pray for the other ones
[00:49.69] At Christmas time, it's hard
[00:53.88] But when you're having fun
[01:06.88] 
[00:57.87] There's a world outside your window
[01:02.45] And it's a world of dreaded fear
[01:06.50] Where the only water flowing
[01:10.63] Is a bitter sting of tears
[01:23.63] 
[01:14.54] And the Christmas bells that ring there
[01:19.36] Are the clanging chimes of doom
[01:23.19] We'll, tonight, thank God, it's them
[01:26.98] Instead of you
[01:33.98] 
[01:31.10] And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
[01:39.69] The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
[01:47.26] Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow
[01:56.44] Do they know it's Christmas time at all?
[02:16.44] 
[02:05.79] Here's to you
[02:07.89] Raise your glass for everyone
[02:09.83] Here's to them
[02:11.40] Underneath that burning sun
[02:14.06] Do they know it's Christmas time at all?
[02:34.06] 
[02:34.59] Feed the world
[02:43.48] Feed the world
[02:50.48] 
[02:51.49] Feed the world
[02:55.84] Let them know it's Christmas time and
[03:00.40] Feed the world
[03:04.21] Let them know it's Christmas time and
[03:08.29] Feed the world
[03:12.31] Let them know it's Christmas time and
