It's Christmastime
there's no need to be afraid
At Christmastime
we let in light
and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty
we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmastime
But say a prayer
pray for the other ones
At Christmastime it's hard
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside
your window
And it's a world of
dread and fear
Where the only water flowing is
The bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that
ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you
And there won't be snow
in Africa
this Christmastime
The greatest gift they'll
Get his year is life (Oooh)
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Do they know
It's Christmastime at all?
Here's to you
Raise a glass for everyone
Here's to them
Underneath that burning sun
Do they know
It's Christmastime at all?
