Howie (NICOTINE): It's Christmas time.
There's no need to be afraid at Christmas time.
We let in light and banish shade
Ellie (QUEEN OF HEARTS) & Howie (NICOTINE): And in our world of plenty.
We can spread a smile of joy throw your arms around
the world at Christmas time.
Brian (MINX): But say a prayer.
Pray for the other ones
Kuruma (BEE'S KNEES): at Christmas time.
It's hard but when you're having fun.
Mike Park (ASIAN MAN): There's a world outside your window
and it's a world of dread and fear
Dan (MU330) & MIke Park (ASIAN MAN): Where the only water flowing is
the bitter sting of tears
Eiji (STUCK INSIDE): And the Christmas bells that ring there
are the clanging chimes of doom
Dan (MU330): Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you.
EVERYONE + Diago & Fumi (TO GROWS), Shawn (MINX) and Yasu, Full & Naoki (NICOTINE): And

there won't be snow in Africa.
This Christmas time
the greatest gift they'll get this year is life.
Where nothing ever grows
no rain or rivers flow.
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

EVERYONE: Here's to you.
Howie (NICOTINE): Raise a glass for everyone.
EVERYONE: Here's to them.
Howie (NICOTINE): Underneath that burning sun.
EVERYONE: Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

EVERYONE: Feed the world.
Let them know it's Christmas time again.
