It's Christmas time, there's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time, we let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmas Time
But say a prayer and pray for the other ones

At Christmas time, it's hard, but when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
And the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears

And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom
Well, tonight thank God it's them instead of you

There won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows, no rain or river flows
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Here's to you, raise a glass for everyone
Here's to them, underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again
